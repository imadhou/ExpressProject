1- error = new ErrorHandler(message, statusCode) returns an object of the ErrorHandler class (which extends the Error class) with 
more error informations;
2- next(error) (express recognize that it's an error even if we don't call throw new Error and emits an error event)
3- the error is intercepted (handled) by the errorController middleware that will respond according to the error status and will 
create custom messages
