# ExpressProject
A web application for selling tours developed with NodeJS as a web server, Express for the backend part (a rest API) MongoDB as a database (mongoose for modeling), PUG for server rendring (React when the API will be completed).

The api is secured by implementing authorization with jwt.
The api is using many roles, so diffrent access levels are managed.

This application is always in development while learning the MERN stack
